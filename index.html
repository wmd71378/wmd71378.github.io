  <p> Hello there! My name is Wimberly Dennis. I am currently in my second semester of my first year at the University of Georgia, but this semester is quickly wrapping up. From pre-kindergarten until twelfth grade, I attended school at Stratford Academy in Macon, Georgia. I loved growing up in Macon, but I was always looking outside the county lines for something more.</p>
  <p>As a kid, most of my friends would spend their summers at home, but I had another place that I preferred to spend my time. That place was YMCA Camp High Harbour. From the summer after first-grade until now I have not missed spending at least a week of my summer at camp. It was at summer camp where I developed into the person I am today. I have spent my summers as a camp and eventually as a counselor. My time spent as a staff member was my favorite because I was able to have a real impact on childrenâ€™s lives and change their lives just as mine was changed by the staff.</p>
  <p>Since I spent my summers at summer camp, I had an extremely wide range of friends from all over the state of Georgia. So, when I came to school at UGA, I already had such a diverse group of friends. I am in the sorority Chi Omega. I have my core group of friends in there, but I am also lucky to have may other friends outside of Chi O. Since I have been able to branch out outside of my community in Macon, it has allowed me to also branch out in Athens at the University of Georgia.</p>
  <h2 style= "text-align:center">Why Go to Camp?</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>You make friends from all over the place that will last you a life time.</li>
    <li>You learn what it means to be independent, meaning you are responsible for yourself. Many people are not exposed to this before they go off to college, and that lack of exposure can cause problems in college.</li>
    <li>You learn how to live with people close quarters. This is extremely helpful when you move off to college and live in a shoebox of a room with one other person, you need to have has an experience extremly similar, or else you will be in for a serious culture shock.
  </ol>
